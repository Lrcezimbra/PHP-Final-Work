PHP-Final-Work
==============

An simple project that I have, it's my Hello World to GitHub.
Is a simple website with login to register clients, employees and events.
I used a template to HTML and CSS and made the server-side with PHP.

I had many folders backup, joined them and publish here. Each folder is a commit.


This is the URL where the website is deployed:
