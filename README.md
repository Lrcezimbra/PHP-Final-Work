PHP-Final-Work
==============

An simple project that I have, is my Hello World to GitHub.
Is a simple website with login to register clients, employees and events.
Was made with PHP(object-oriented) and MVC.

I had many folders backup, joined them and publish here. Each folder is a commit


This is the URL where the website is deployed:
